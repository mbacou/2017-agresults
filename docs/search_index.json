DO NOT USE OR CITE Section 1 Survey Sampling These pages document data sources and methods used to generate detailed spatially-referenced characteristics of farm households interviewed as part of AgResults 2015-2017 program evaluation in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda. All statistics are derived using the geospatial locations of surveyed respondents. However these locations are sometimes missing or invalid. In the case of missing coordinates we generate spatial statistics at the centroid of the matching administrative unit (the lowest level unit that may be mapped with any confidence, i.e. LGA for Nigeria, county for Kenya, and district for Uganda). Note that another approach would be to derive average statistics over the entire administrative unit, however this approach is more resource-intensive. 1.1 Nigeria 2,065 households are sampled in Nigeria. There are 81 households missing coordinates and 414 possibly invalid locations.

In the majority of instances the distance is negligeable (under 10km) and this might not affect any of the spatial estimates. In a few instances the errors are troublesome (over 40km). For documentation purposes households with problematic locations are highlighted on the map below. Fig. 1.1: Households with Invalid GPS Locations, Nigeria 1.2 Kenya In Kenya data was collected over 2 rounds with some attrition, and household locations do not necessarily match across rounds. We use a general approach to impute missing, invalid, and/or conflicting coordinates: if both GPS locations seem valid (i.e. they are located in the reported county), we use their middle point (coded mean in table below) if only 1 of the 2 locations is valid, we use that one (coded bl1 or bl2) if no location is valid (both fall outside of a recorded administrative unit), we use that administrative unit centroid (coded centroid). 5,235 households are sampled in Kenya. There is a total of 88 households with missing or invalid coordinates. Table below shows a breakown of imputed household locations across Kenya’s 8 regions and 47 counties. Note that we could not locate a map of Kenya’s sub-counties.

["data-sources-and-preprocessing.html", "Section 2 Data Sources and Preprocessing 2.1 Climatic Indicators 2.2 Drought 2.3 Soil Characteristics 2.4 Market Access", " Section 2 Data Sources and Preprocessing 2.1 Climatic Indicators Notes on extracting monthly and dekadal climatic indicators from FEWSNET and WorldClim repositories. In the case of FEWSNET all spatial layers are extracted from Jan. 2015 to the latest recorded data point (typically May or June 2017). These data extracts may be used to generate summary statistics over specific planting/growing seasons (for info the effects of biophysical stresses over a typical year are illustrated below). Fig. 2.1: Seasonal Calendar (Haigh et al., 2015) WorldClim is a repository of long-term climatic time-series for the period 1970-2000 from which to derive 30-year normal baseline data. 2.1.1 FEWSNET FEWS spatial grids are distributed through multiple channels, primarily USGS and NOAA data portals. There is a series of interactive viewers and tools to explore and download slices of FEWS’ bioclimatic indicators, e.g.: http://ewx.chg.ucsb.edu:8080/EWX/index.html https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/mapviewer/index.php?region=af To the author’s knowledge there is no Web service or API to facilitate programmatic access to all of FEWSNET data archives, only public FTP locations1: FEWS/USGS https://edcintl.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/sciweb1/shared/fews/web/ Contains RFE2, PET3, ETa4, NDVI5 at different timescales (daily, dekadal, monthly, yearly) and resolutions (usually 1km or lower), and across different regions in Africa.

An alternative source is SPEIBase v2.4 (2016), but this database does not include the last 2 years 2015-2017 yet and the 0.5 degree resolution is a little coarse for this study. USGS also warns that the most recent 3 dekadal grids are not always corrected for cloud cover (cloud mask produces misleading zero values).

They are listed here for reference, but not used. 2.1.3.1 IrriSAT IrriSAT is a weather based irrigation scheduling service which is used to inform farmers how much water their crop has used and how much how much irrigation they need to apply. Information is produced daily, and can work across large spatial scales. The IrriSAT methodology uses satellite images to determine a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each field, from which the plant canopy size can be determined and a specific crop coefficient (Kc) can be estimated. IrriSAT provides a web API to batch retrieve daily NDVI and Kc at user-specified locations. irrisat.services.data.cropgrowth() 2.1.3.2 aWhere aWhere is a US for-profit that provides simplified access to current (up to 30 months) global weather conditions at registered field locations. Recently aWhere launched an R client to access their Web APIs. The service is not free (and acccording to their literature it is not meant to collect data for hundred or thousands of point locations). Similar information is available for free from AfSIS and WorldGrids (see below). 2.1.3.3 University of East Anglia CRU TS v4.00 http://browse.ceda.ac.uk/browse/badc/cru/data/cru_ts/cru_ts_4.00/ 2.1.3.4 ECMWF ERA5 (2010–2016) ERA5 is a global atmospheric reanalysis (replacing ERA-Interim). ERA5 Climate reanalysis gives a numerical description of the recent climate, produced by combining models with observations. It contains estimates of atmospheric parameters such as air and soil temperature, pressure and wind at different altitudes, and surface parameters such as rainfall, soil moisture content, sea-surface temperature and wave height. ERA5 provides data at a considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution than its predecessor ERA-Interim: hourly analysis fields are available at a horizontal resolution of 31 km, and on 137 levels from the surface up to around 80 km. Data download is possible through a Web API. 2.2 Drought Aside from SPEIBase, drought events are also tracked by NASA EONET. NASA EONET API documentation is at https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1. There’s an R package to query this repository at http://enelmargen.org/nasadata/vignette_v0/. The source of actual drought incidence is also tracked by SEDAC Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution v1 1980-2000), but this source is quite old. { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EONET Event Categories&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;List of all the available event categories in the EONET system&quot;, &quot;link&quot;: &quot;http://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/categories&quot;, &quot;categories&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: 6, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Drought&quot;, &quot;link&quot;: &quot;http://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/categories/6&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Long lasting absence of precipitation affecting agriculture and livestock, and the overall availability of food and water.&quot;, &quot;layers&quot;: &quot;http://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/layers/6&quot; } } 2.3 Soil Characteristics Data on soil characteristics is obtained from ISRIC and the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS). AfSIS generates maps of soil properties at 250m and 1km resolution using legacy soil profile data (from about 12,000 locations in Africa) combined with remote sensing information (climate, land cover, population density, biodiversity, and other covariates). All indicators are available for download at http://geonode.isric.org/ with a web viewer at https://www.soilgrids.org/. The SoilGrids REST API provides support to access data, query and display it, without the need to download the complete grids. REST access to SoilGrids is available through R GSIF package (but too slow to query thousands of points). The following grids were acquired instead: Tab. 2.2: Tally of Indicators and Raster Layers extracted from SoilGrids Indicator Label Resolution Rasters ORCDRC_M_sl1_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 0 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl2_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 5 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl3_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 15 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl4_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 30 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl5_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 60 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl6_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 100 cm 250m 1 ORCDRC_M_sl7_250m_ll soil organic carbon content at 200 cm 250m 1 TAXNWRB_250m_ll soil class based on the World Reference Base 250m 1 Fig. 2.11: Dominant Soil Texture.

These estimates are travel times to 20K, 50K, 100K, 250K, and 500K market sizes, at a resolution of 5-arc minute (~10 km) for sub-Saharan Africa. Fig. 2.13: IFPRI/HarvestChoice Travel Time to 20K Market (hrs, circa 2010) Fig. 2.14: IFPRI/HarvestChoice Travel Time to 100K Market (hrs, circa 2010) 2.4.2 CIESIN/GRUMP Maps of roads and settlements are also available from CIESIN/GRUMP at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/grump-v1. Below is an example for Nigeria. Red areas are within a 5 km distance buffer to a mapped road. NGA network For reference there is an R geoknife and Python PyGDP library to access a subset of USGS rasters off CIDA’s THREDDS server, but currently that repository does not incorporate FEWSNET data.↩ NOAA CPC RFE Rainfall Estimates (version 2.0) for data over Africa – daily precipitation is obtained by merging GTS gauge observations and 3 kinds of satellite estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Resolution is 0.1 degree. Units are in millimeters (mm). The RFE algorithm is based on the PingPing Xie method currently being employed as an operational product at the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center in association with USAID/FEWS-NET. Maps of daily, dekadal, and monthly rainfall estimates, as well as documentation on the RFE algorithm methodology may be found at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/fews/rfe.shtml.↩ Potential Evapotranspiration – daily global PET is calculated from climate parameter data that is extracted from Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) analysis fields. The GDAS data is generated every 6 hours by NOAA. The GDAS fields used as input to the PET calculation include air temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation (long wave, short wave, outgoing and incoming). PET is computed for each 6 hour period and then summed to obtain daily totals. A day is defined as beginning at 00 hours GMT. The daily PET is calculated on a spatial basis using the Penman-Monteith equation (the formulation of Shuttleworth (1992) for reference crop evaporation is used). These equations were standardized in accordance with the FAO publication 56 for the 6-hourly calculations (Allen et al, 1998). The daily PET values are scaled up by a factor of 100 to preserve the precision to .01 mm. The PET data have a 1 deg. ground resolution and are global in spatial extent.↩ SSEBop Evapotranspiration Products (version 4) – ET is the combination of transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from soil. Actual ET (ETa) is produced using the operational SSEBop model (Senay et al., 2012) for the period 2000 to present. This model combines ET fractions generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with reference ET using a thermal index approach. The unique feature of the SSEBop parameterization is that it uses pre-defined, seasonally dynamic, boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the “hot/dry” and “cold/wet” reference points. The actual ET data unit is millimeters (mm). The anomalies are the ratio of ETa and the corresponding median ETa, expressed as a percent value.↩ eMODIS NDVI C6 – distributed by USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. Satellite-derived vegetation products generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). These products, known as eMODIS, respond to operational land monitoring applications requiring near-real time Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for comparison against historical records. Real-time and historical NDVI products are composited in 10-day intervals every 5 days on a Geographic mapping grid.↩ NOAA Climate Prediction Center Africa Rainfall Climatology (version 2) – this data is a result of a project to create a satellite-estimated precipitation climatology over the Africa domain. This climatology has been created to compliment the daily operational rainfall estimate product (RFE) in order to generate anomaly fields over Africa over various timescales. In contrast to the RFE, where inputs include SSMI, AMSUB, half-hourly GPI, and GTS data, ARC uses only 3-hourly GPI and GTS data, exclusively This is due to the absence of microwave-derived estimates over a long-term historical record, and the large amount of data which makes up the operational half-hourly GPI input. As such, the ARC algorithm itself has been slightly modified in order to maintain a homogeneous and stable climate data record. GTS rain gauge data used in both static and daily-updating climatology products is of the same source, though inputs used to create GPI estimates differ slightly in source. For creation of the climatological GPI, 3-hourly Meteosat data was obtained directly from Eumetsat’s archived data group, while daily-updating products use 3-hourly data pulled from NOAA’s Meteosat data feed. Data resolution and specifications of the ARC dataset are identical to that of the RFE.↩ NOAA CPC RFE Rainfall Estimates (version 2.0) for data over Africa – daily precipitation is obtained by merging GTS gauge observations and 3 kinds of satellite estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Resolution is 0.1 degree. Units are in millimeters (mm). The RFE algorithm is based on the PingPing Xie method currently being employed as an operational product at the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center in association with USAID/FEWS-NET. Maps of daily, dekadal, and monthly rainfall estimates, as well as documentation on the RFE algorithm methodology may be found at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/fews/rfe.shtml.↩ "],
